The challenge

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Running the program ##
Program was developed using Python 3.12, but may be running on lower versions as well.
Run the program in the root directory of the repository by executing:
```bash
python demcon.py
```

The solution will be printed to standard output.
